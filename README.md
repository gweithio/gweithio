### Hey, I'm Ethan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Developer from South Wales, UK. I program in PHP, Golang & C quite frequently. You can find me sometimes streaming on Twitch working on Developer Tools, Interpreters, Backend Development or Embedded Development.

I have blog [here](https://www.epmor.app/)

To get away from the Microsoft ecosystem I've started putting projects on [Source Hut](https://sr.ht/~gweithio/)

P.S - I use Neovim pretty much all the time.

To contact me quickly and easily, [DM me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/glassofethanol).
