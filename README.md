### Hey, I'm Ethan üëã

I'm a 23 year old developer.

## üî≠ Current

I'm currently working at [Hoowla](https://www.hoowla.com/) (remotely) - a prop tech startup, making it super easy for any solicitor to manage their Conveyancing or Non-Conveyancing cases and financials.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Experience

More-less a Full-Stack dev (more backend leaning), I use [Go](https://go.dev/) or [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) to build my realtime/backend server, and I pair that with [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) on the frontend. 
I'm a huge fan of functional programming with [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) and [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) being my favourite two, for purity-sake I dabble in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) if I'm feeling smarter than I actually am. 

I've been working with Vue, JS, Scala, Go for roughly 3 years and PHP for 1 year, 

At my current role at Hoowla, I'm mostly using [PHP](https://www.php.net/), [Go](https://go.dev/) and [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/)

P.S - I use Neovim pretty much all the time.
