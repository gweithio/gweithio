### Hey, I'm Ethan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 23 year old developer.

I'm currently working at [Hoowla](https://www.hoowla.com/) (remotely) - a prop tech startup, making it super easy for any solicitor to manage their Conveyancing or Non-Conveyancing cases and financials. We're mostly using [PHP](https://www.php.net/), [Go](https://go.dev/) and [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/)

I have blog [here](https://www.epmor.app/)

Been working with [Odin Programming Language](https://odin-lang.org/) increasingly over time.

P.S - I use Neovim pretty much all the time.

To contact me quickly and easily, [DM me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/glassofethanol).
