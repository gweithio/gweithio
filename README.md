### Hey, I'm Ethan 👋

I'm a 23 year old developer.

## 🔭 Current

I'm currently working at [Hoowla](https://www.hoowla.com/) (remotely) - a prop tech startup, making it super easy for any solicitor to manage their Conveyancing or Non-Conveyancing cases and financials.

## ⚡️ Experience

More-less a Full-Stack dev (more backend leaning), I use [Go](https://go.dev/) to build my realtime/backend server, and I pair that with React on the frontend. 

I've been working with React, JS, Elixir, Go for roughly 3 years and PHP for 1 year, 

At my current role at Hoowla, I'm mostly using [PHP](https://www.php.net/), [Go](https://go.dev/) and [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/)

P.S - I use Vim pretty much all the time.
