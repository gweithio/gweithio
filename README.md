### Hey, I'm Ethan 👋

I'm a 23 year old developer.

## 🔭 Current

I'm currently working at [Hoowla](https://www.hoowla.com/) (remotely) - a prop tech startup, making it super easy for any solicitor to manage their Conveyancing or Non-Conveyancing cases and financials.

## ⚡️ Experience

Moreless a Full-Stack dev (more backend leaning), I use [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) to build my realtime/backend server, and I pair that with React on the frontend. I've been working with React for about 1.5 years, Elixir for roughly 3, and JavaScript for around 6 years. But, my current role at Hoowla, I'm mostly using [PHP](https://www.php.net/), [Go](https://go.dev/) and [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/)
